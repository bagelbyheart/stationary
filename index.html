<div class="content"><h1>Bagelbyheart CSS Example</h1>
<p>The purpose of this document is to develop and demonstrate a personal web style for myself going forward. Eventually it will include examples of any common use case I can think of.</p>

<div class="content"><h2>Paragraph Readability</h2>

<p>Sphinx of Black Quartz, judge my vow. I test the width of this page here and now. In order to better understand typical readability while designing my new website. </p>

<p>Gorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the crude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety. When the road dips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes, and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills chatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous, creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping bullfrogs. The thin, shining line of the Miskatonic's upper reaches has an oddly serpentlike suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills among which it rises.</p>
<p>The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter.</p>

<div class="content"><!-- Paragraphs with no header  -->
<p>Paragraphs with no header in a content div makes it clear that if I'm doing a new content div it needs a header of some kind.</p>

<div class="content"><h2>List examples</h2>

<h3>Unordered List</h3>
<p>I'll test unordered list formatting here</p>
<ul>
<li>Item 1</li>
<li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
<p>And how text right after a list appears here</p>

<h3>Ordered List</h3>
<p>And ordered list formatting will go here</p>
<ol>
<li>Apples</li>
<li>Oranges</li>
